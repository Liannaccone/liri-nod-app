## Setup and installation

You will need to obtain Twitter and Spotify API keys and add them to a .env file saved in the same directory. 

Next, navigate to the file in your terminal and if the package.json file is in the folder with the required dependencies, simply run:

```
npm install
```

otherwise, install each package individually:

```
npm install fs twitter dotenv node-spotify-api inquirer
```
